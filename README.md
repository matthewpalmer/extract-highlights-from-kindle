1. Attach Kindle via USB
2. Get the MyClippings.txt file from the Documents directory on your kindle
3. Make a backup of this (i.e. copy/paste original to new location - do not change your original)
4. Isolate the book you want by manually deleting the other books (this is not as difficult as it sounds)
5. Save this isolated file as your source file; create a destination file; change the filepath in the first two lines to whatever you need
6. Replace 'Fra' on line 19 with the first three letters of your book's title
7. Run the script
